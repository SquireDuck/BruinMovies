# Bruin Movies

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Bruin Movie is a social app designed to strengthen student connections through shared movie experiences. The app will allow users to explore a list of films in near-by theaters and connect with other students with similar movie tastes to form watch parties.

## Getting Started  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:  

### 1. Set Up the Backend

2. Configure environment variables:  
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.  
   - Include the following variables:  
     ```env
     EMAIL=<your-email>
     PASSWORD=<your-password>
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<your-nextjs-api-url>
     MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
     ```  

### 2. Install Dependencies

2. Set up a Python virtual environment:
Note: Steps 2.1 and 2.2 may not be required depending on your environment setup. Check with your groupmates for consistency.
  - Create a virtual environment:
    ```
    python3 -m venv myenv
    ```
  - Activate the virtual environment:
    ```
    source myenv/bin/activate
    // on some computers the path might be different; for example: source myenv/scripts/activate
    // ls into your myenv directory to check
    ```
  - Install Python dependencies:
    ```
    pip install flask flask-cors pymongo dnspython email-validator flask-mail python-dotenv beautifulsoup4 requests
    ```

### 3. Run the Backend Server

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```
2. Start the backend server:
   ```
   python ./app.py
   ```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the development server using one of the following commands:
   ```
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
