# Bruin Movies

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Bruin Movie is a social app designed to strengthen student connections through shared movie experiences. The app will allow users to explore a list of films in near-by theaters and connect with other students with similar movie tastes to form watch parties.
